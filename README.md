#Hong Kong Apple Store iPhone 6s/6s plus reserve checker (also support other countries)

It will check Hong Kong iPhone reserve for you(if you need other countries, edit config.py), when available, send a push to you by using pushbullet

Before you go, install pushbullet client for python
```
pip install pushbullet.py
```

Install [pushbullet][1] on your iPhone/Android/Mac/PC/Chrome.

Edit config.py, insert your own pushbullet [access token][2].

When your iPhone is available, I will send you a push.

PS: if you have InsecurePlatformWarning, solution is [here][3].
